# Music Popularity Prediction

This project predicts whether a song is popular or not based on its audio features using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Project Steps
- Loaded the Spotify dataset from Kaggle.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- Defined popularity as a binary target (score > 50).
- Trained a Random Forest model on the audio features.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% and an F1-score of XX.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter`
3. Run the `music_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
